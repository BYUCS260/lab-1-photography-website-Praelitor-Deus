        <p>"John did such a fantastic job with the photoshoot! I was skeptical of his abilities
            before the shoot because he mostly does landscape photography but he knew exactly how
            to get the background, lighting, and poses right."</p>

        <h2>- Eugene</h2>
        <p>"My band needed some headshots for our upcoming album release and a friend referred
            us. John was professional and knowledgable and talked to us about what kind of tone
            we wanted to set with our shots. The whole process was easy and fun and I think the
            pictures speak for themselves."</p>

        <p>"John did a really great job with my senior pictures. He found a location nearby
            that was just perfect, and really helped me feel relaxed, as taking pictures is not
            really my favorite thing to do. The shots turned out awesome!"</p>

        <h2>- Ryan</h2>
        <p>"I've been trying to get into modeling for some time. I found some of John's
            pictures on instagram and reached out. John has worked with models before and
            knew some of the shots that agencies are looking for. We shot together for a
            few hours and John was very helpful through the whole afternoon."</p>
